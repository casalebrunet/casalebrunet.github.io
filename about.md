## About me
Simone Casale-Brunet was born in Courmayeur, Italy, in 1986. He received the the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and the M.S. degree in Mechatronics Engineering, both with honours, from the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in 2015. In 2010, he joined the EPFL SCI STI MM group as a doctoral assistant, and in 2015 became a research scientist under the supervision of Dr. Marco Mattavelli. He is member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), IEEE Computer Society (CS), IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CSS) and IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation (CEDA). His research interests include design space exploration of heterogeneous parallel systems and advanced control theory.
